# SALES-INSIGHT-HARNESSING-DATA-POWER-WITH-POWER-BI
This project was made for an Indian client whose business was to supply Indian products in Canada for those Indian people who reside in Canada now. In this project,

•	KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), line graphs (with forecasting), and matrix charts are created.
•	Identified who was the most likely buyer of his products, i.e., the top 100 customers on the list, as well as who was the least likely buyer of his products, i.e., the bottom 100 customers on the list.
•	Optimized the dashboard's performance by implementing best practices for data loading, calculation, and visualization rendering.
